I'll create a new project for this.\n\nA basic web-based chess game structure is now complete, Sir! The 'Chess Game' project contains `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Please note that due to the complexity of chess rules, the `script.js` includes simplified logic for piece movement and turn management. You can open `index.html` to play."}

A full Temple Run game involves complex 3D graphics, physics engines, and procedural generation, which are quite beyond the scope of our current tools for simple web creation. However, I could certainly create a simplified 2D endless runner concept using JavaScript and CSS that captures the core mechanics! Would you like to proceed with a 'simplified run'?"}
