We can break down the implementation into key phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Hardware Bridge & Connectivity**\n*   **ESP32 Selection:** Choose a suitable ESP32 development board with integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.\n*   **Internet Connection:** Configure the ESP32 to establish a stable Wi-Fi connection, essential for accessing the AI API.\n\n**Phase 2: Firmware Development**\n*   **Bluetooth Interface:** Develop firmware for the ESP32 to handle Bluetooth communication with the neckband, processing audio input and output.\n*   **API Bridge:** Implement the logic to format user commands, send them to the AI API over Wi-Fi, and process the returned responses.\n\n**Phase 3: Integration & Testing**\n*   **End-to-End Test:** Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure seamless voice transmission from the neckband, accurate API communication, and clear audio playback."}

While my virtual hands can't quite handle the physical flashing or soldering just yet, I can certainly provide the digital backbone. I can help generate the necessary code files, structure the Bluetooth and API communication logic, and even use web tools to find the perfect libraries and specific guides for your ESP32 setup. We'll get you from plan to prototype in no time!"}
